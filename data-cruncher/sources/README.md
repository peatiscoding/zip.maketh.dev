## Data Source Notes

### Postal Code Data Source Change

The postal code data source has been changed from PDF parsing to Wikipedia scraping due to text extraction issues with the original PDF format. The Wikipedia source provides the same comprehensive postal code information but in a more reliable HTML table format.

**Previous Source**: [Thailand Post PDF](https://file.thailandpost.com/upload/content/_5e856abf6c77a.pdf) - Had parsing issues with text positioning  
**Current Source**: [Thai Wikipedia](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2) - Reliable HTML table structure
